# elevatorSaga
Technical Challenge for Foundry
-----------------------------------

We want you to play elevatorsaga.com , and then we’ll talk about it.  :)

    1. Create a new Github repo

    2. Try and solve as much of elevatorsaga as you can using the prompts and api documentation.

    3. Each solution to a given challenge # in elevatorsaga should be tagged as a release in your repo.  The hope is your solution can solve each challenge as one large program, not lots of smaller programs.

    4 .Please do not cheat, don’t copy or reference pre-written solutions from other people, etc ( we can tell ).  Normal Googling is fine of course.  We’re not expecting you to beat the whole thing in 4 hours, it’s more important for us to see how you approach the problem at various stages and so on.
